A FPGA Dogecoin Miner

# Description
This project is a Dogecoin miner intended to run on an FPGA (with some computer interfacing for connecting to the network). This is primarily a project for me to learn and practice a couple of different things:
* Practice FPGA developmnet
* Learn VHDL
* Learn about cryptocurrency
* Learn FPGA based cryptographic implementations

I want the project to actually conceptually work at the end, but I don't expect it to be particularly efficient and probably won't ever actually successfully mine anything.

I also intend to keep a Wiki to document my design process, as I hope that will help motivate me and direct me. And because I want to work on documentation.

# Infrastructure
I intend the project to run on a Arty A7 (as its the FPGA dev board I own), programmed via Vivado.
I don't really know much about CI/CD and stuff like that, but I like the idea of them. I have no clue how I would implement them, so I may tackle that, but its much later down the line.
